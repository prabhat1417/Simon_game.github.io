# Simon Game
The Simon Game is a classic memory game that challenges players to remember and repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. 
It consists of a console with four colored buttons, each corresponding to a unique sound. 
The game starts with a simple pattern, and as players successfully replicate the sequence, it progressively becomes more complex.
